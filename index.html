 <p>[Hello! A paragraph about myself? Well my favourite color is pink, I love Burger King and right now im upset about the new JJK spoilers. My main aspriations for this year is to complete with a 3.6 or greater GPA and to connect well with my teachers, all while putting what i learn in this class to good use. Why am i interested in Web Development? I love ht ebalance between techinal and creative skills. Plus the magic of it overall. The ability to start with a blank sheet and create something. Im not an artist, but being able to create something that does more that pop up a shell and output computational results was a big step.]</p>
